Order estimation for lowpass digital filter cases based
on the equations and coefficients in [^Rabiner]. The original
equation returned the minimum filter length, whereas this implementation
returns the order (N=L-1). `Wp` and `Ws` are the normalized passband and
stopband frequencies, with `Rp` indicating the passband ripple and `Rs` is the
stopband attenuation (linear.)

NOTE: The value of N is an initial approximation. If under-estimated, the order
should be increased until the design specifications are met.
