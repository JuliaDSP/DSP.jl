Calculate the minimax optimal filter using the Remez exchange algorithm [^McClellan1973a] [^McClellan1973b].

This is the simplified API that accepts just 2 required arguments (numtaps, band_defs).
For a scipy compatible version see the 3 arguments version (numtaps, bands, desired). 

Calculate the filter-coefficients for the finite impulse response
(FIR) filter whose transfer function minimizes the maximum error
between the desired gain and the realized gain in the specified
frequency bands using the Remez exchange algorithm.

# Arguments
- `numtaps::Integer`: The desired number of taps in the filter. 
    The number of taps is the number of terms in the filter, or the filter 
    order plus one.
- `bands_defs`: A sequence of band definitions.
    This sequence defines the bands. Each entry is a pair. The pair's
    first item is a tuple of band edges (low, high). The pair's second item 
    defines the desired response and weight in that band. The weight is optional
    and defaults to 1.0. Both the desired response and weight may be either scalars
    or functions. If a function, the function should accept a real frequency and
    return the real desired response or real weight. Examples:
    + LPF with unity weights. `[(0, 0.475) => 1, (0.5, 1.0) => 0]`
    + LPF with weight of 2 in the stop band. `[(0, 0.475) => (1, 1), (0.5, 1.0) => (0, 2)]`
    + BPF with unity weights. `[(0, 0.375) => 0, (0.4, 0.5) => 1, (0.525, 1.0) => 0]`
    + Hilbert transformer. `[(0.1, 0.95) => 1]; neg=true`
    + Differentiator. `[(0.01, 0.99) => (f -> f/2, f -> 1/f)]; neg=true`
- `Hz::Real`: The sampling frequency in Hz. Default is 1.
- `neg::Bool`: Whether the filter has negative symmetry or not. Default is false.
    If false, the filter is even-symmetric. If true, the filter is odd-symmetric.
    neg=true means that h[n]=-h[end+1-n]; neg=false means that h[n]=h[end+1-n].
- `maxiter::Integer`: (optional)
    Maximum number of iterations of the algorithm. Default is 25.
- `grid_density:Integer`: (optional)
    Grid density. The dense grid used in `remez` is of size
    `(numtaps + 1) * grid_density`. Default is 16.

# Returns
- `h::Array{Float64,1}`: A rank-1 array containing the coefficients of the optimal
    (in a minimax sense) filter.

# Examples
Construct a length 35 filter with a passband at 0.15-0.4 Hz 
(desired response of 1), and stop bands at 0-0.1 Hz and 0.45-0.5 Hz
(desired response of 0). Note: the behavior in the frequency ranges between 
those bands - the transition bands - is unspecified.

```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)
julia> bpass = remez(35, [(0, 0.1)=>0, (0.15, 0.4)=>1, (0.45, 0.5)=>0]);
```

You can trade-off maximum error achieved for transition bandwidth. 
The wider the transition bands, the lower the maximum error in the
bands specified. Here is a bandpass filter with the same passband, but
wider transition bands.

```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)
julia> bpass2 = remez(35, [(0, 0.08)=>0, (0.15, 0.4)=>1, (0.47, 0.5)=>0]);
```

Here we compute the frequency responses and plot them in dB.

```julia-repl
julia> using PyPlot
julia> b = DSP.Filters.PolynomialRatio(bpass, [1.0])
julia> b2 = DSP.Filters.PolynomialRatio(bpass2, [1.0])
julia> f = range(0, stop=0.5, length=1000)
julia> plot(f, 20*log10.(abs.(freqz(b,f,1.0))))
julia> plot(f, 20*log10.(abs.(freqz(b2,f,1.0))))
julia> grid()
```

```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)

```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)
julia> h = remez(152, [(0, 0.475) => (1, 1), (0.5, 1.0) => (0, 2)]; Hz=2.0);
```

Length 51 HPF (High Pass Filter).
```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)
julia> h = remez(51, [(0, 0.75) => 0, (0.8, 1.0) => 1]; Hz=2.0);
```

Length 180 BPF (Band Pass Filter).
```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)
julia> h = remez(180, [(0, 0.375) => 0, (0.4, 0.5) => 1, (0.525, 1.0) => 0]; Hz=2.0, maxiter=30);
```

# Examples from the unittests - Odd-symmetric filters - hilbert and differentiators type.
Even length - has a much better approximation since the response is not constrained to 0 at
the nyquist frequency.  Length 20 Hilbert transformer.
```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)
julia> h = remez(20, [(0.1, 0.95) => 1]; neg=true, Hz=2.0);
```

Length 21 Hilbert transformer.
```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)
julia> h = remez(21, [(0.1, 0.95) => 1]; neg=true, Hz=2.0);
```

Length 200 differentiator.
```jldoctest; setup = :(using DSP)
julia> h = remez(200, [(0.01, 0.99) => (f -> f/2, f -> 1/f)]; neg=true, Hz=2.0);

This is the scipy compatible version that requires 3 arguments (numtaps, bands, desired). 
For a simplified API, see the 2 argument version (numtaps, band_defs). The filters
designed are equivalent, the inputs are just specified in a different way.
Below the arguments and examples are described that differ from the simplified
API version.

# Arguments
- `bands::Vector`: A monotonic sequence containing the band edges in Hz.
    All elements must be non-negative and less than half the sampling
    frequency as given by `Hz`.
- `desired::Vector`:A sequence half the size of bands containing the desired 
    gain in each of the specified bands.
- `weight::Vector`: (optional)
    A relative weighting to give to each band region. The length of
    `weight` has to be half the length of `bands`.
- `filter_type::RemezFilterType`: Default is `filter_type_bandpass`.
    The type of filter:
    +  `filter_type_bandpass` : flat response in bands. This is the default.
    +  `filter_type_differentiator` : frequency proportional response in bands.
        Odd symetric as in `filter_type_hilbert` case, but with a linear sloping
        desired response.
    +  `filter_type_hilbert` : filter with odd symmetry, that is, type III
                  (for even order) or type IV (for odd order)
                  linear phase filters.

# Examples
Compare the examples with the simplified API and the Scipy API.
Each of the following blocks first designs a filter using the 
simplified (recommended) API, and then designs the same filter
using the Scipy-compatible API.
